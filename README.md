**Tic Tac Toe Game**
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbol on the board until one player wins or the board is filled.

This project was created as a learning attempt to practice building a Tic Tac Toe game using React. As such, it may not be optimized for production use and may contain bugs or issues. I welcome any feedback or suggestions to help improve the code and my understanding of React.
